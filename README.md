**Holberton School Project Collection**

This repository contains a collection of Python projects completed as part of the Holberton School curriculum. These projects serve as a testament to my progress in learning and mastering the Python programming language.

**Project Categories**

-   **python-almost_a_circle:** (All topics )
-   **python-classes:** Introductions to object-oriented programming in Python.
-   **python-data_structures:** Exploration and practice with lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
-   **python-everything_is_object:** Demonstrations of Python's object-oriented nature.
-   **python-exceptions:** Exercises in error handling and exceptions.
-   **python-hello_world:** Fundamental "Hello World" programs and basic syntax practice.
-   **python-if_else_loops_functions:** Core Python concepts using control flow, loops, and functions.
-   **python-import_modules:** Working with modules and import mechanisms.
-   **python-inheritance:** Object-oriented principles through inheritance and class relationships.
-   **python-input_output:** File reading, writing, and JSON serialization techniques.
-   **python-more_classes:** Advanced class concepts and design patterns.
-   **python-more_data_structures:** Complex data structures (Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, etc.) and algorithms.
-   **python-test_driven_development:** Projects utilizing test-driven development practices.

**Structure**

Each project category resides within its own directory. Projects generally include following elements:

-   **Source code files (.py):** The main programs containing Python logic.
-   **README.md:** (Within Project Directories) Project-specific instructions, explanations, and usage examples.
-   **Tests (if applicable):** Unit tests ensuring code correctness.

**Getting Started**

2.  Clone or download the repository.
4.  Install Python 3 ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
6.  Install any required dependencies outlined in project-specific READMEs.
8.  Navigate to the directory of a desired project.
10.  Refer to the project's README file for instructions on running the code or tests.
